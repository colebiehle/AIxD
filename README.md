<b>Tool Selection & Justification</b>
- Tool: Claude Code (CLI) running within VS Code.
- Why it fits: I’ve heard great things about Claude and wanted a solid excuse to finally try it out. By running Claude Code directly inside VS Code, I get to experiment with a new, high-agency tool while staying in an environment I’m already comfortable with.
- Design Control: Since my project involves a lot of subtle design choices, I’m leaning into Claude’s ability to handle complex "vibes". I’m also using the Impeccable framework to keep a close eye on UX quality. I considered Cursor as a second choice for similar reasons, but I figured I’ll save that for another time.

<b>Version Control Strategy</b>
- How I’ll track changes: I’ve got a GitHub repo set up to maintain good control over any changes. I plan to use branches to keep things organized, and I'll be writing detailed commit messages so I actually understand the code I’m pushing later on.
- The Safety Net: If an AI revision goes south or things get weird, I’m not going to push those changes to the main branch. Instead, I’ll just revert back to a previous version using Git or Claude’s native /checkpoint and /rewind features to keep the project stable.
- Session Notes: To make sure I don't lose the "why" behind what I'm doing, I'm going to take notes during my coding sessions to track my progress and understand the evolution of the prototype.
